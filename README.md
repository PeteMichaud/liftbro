=======

Tracks your weight training progress, with graphs, bro. Yeah, you lift.

## Todo

*  Build Routines with excercises and set counts
*  Sessions follow a routine, and track sets and reps with weights and notes
*  Dashboard graphs progress
*  Mobile Friendly so people can use it on their tablet or phone while in the gym
*  Track Weight and Body Fat per session(?). Probably want to track circumference 
   measurements independently (thighs, waist, chest, etc)
*  Should tell you how much to lift based on previous sessions. Use the 
   Stronglifts formulae to figure out if you need to increase weight, stay the 
   same, or deload.

### Stretch 

*  Track Diet along with sessions (foods, macronutrient breakdowns, calories)

# Question:

Do you even lift?
